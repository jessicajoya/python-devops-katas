# python-devops-katas

## Overview

This repository contains a set of Python katas implemented following DevOps-oriented practices.
The objective is not only to solve the exercises, but to structure the project in a way that supports
testing, automation, containerization, and API exposure.

The project is developed incrementally, applying clean code principles and clear version control practices.

## Problem Description

The repository includes the implementation of three Python katas:

1. **Dictionary kata**  
   Implement a class that allows adding words and their definitions, and retrieving them by key.

2. **Total cost kata**  
   Given a dictionary of item prices, a list of purchased items, and a tax value, calculate the final total cost.
   Items not present in the cost dictionary must be ignored.

3. **Nth character kata**  
   Given an array of words, construct a new word by concatenating the nth character of each word,
   where n corresponds to the word's position in the list.

Each kata is designed to be implemented as isolated, testable logic.

## Project Structure

The repository structure was defined before implementing any logic to ensure scalability and clarity.
